This is a simple guessing game.

In the first prompt, tell me your name.

In the second prompt, type in how many ingredients you think are in my french toast recipe.

You will be notified if you guessed the correct number or not and given clues on whether the number you guessed was too high or too low.

If you get it right, I share the recipe with you. If you get it wrong, I'll tell you if you need to guess higher or lower.

Thanks for playing!
